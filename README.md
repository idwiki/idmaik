Hello!   I am a German musician and my artist name is "ID MM". I sell my electronic music at "AMAZON", "iTunes" and other shops and streaming services. I started in 2012 to compose electronic music. Sometimes I take pictures and I create CD-MP3-Covers or other graphical works. I also published ebooks and paper-books with the titles „Attack Of The Spider Woman“ and „Der Kampf Der Spinnenfrau“.  I am urgently searching lyrics-writers and singers for my instrumental electronic tracks! If You want to work with me than write me and take a look at my Twitter-site: Maik Mueller (ID MM)- URL:   https://twitter.com/MaikMueller1  Greetings ID MM
